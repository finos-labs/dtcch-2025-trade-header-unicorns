TitanTech Inc. Declares 15% Dividend Increase as Revenue Surges in Q4

New York, NY – February 4, 2025 – TitanTech Inc. (NASDAQ: TTCH), a leading global provider of advanced semiconductor solutions, announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.85 per share, representing a 15% increase compared to the previous quarter.

The dividend is payable on March 20, 2025, to shareholders of record as of March 5, 2025, with an ex-dividend date of March 4, 2025. The company’s annualized dividend yield now stands at 2.8%, reflecting its continued commitment to returning value to shareholders through both consistent dividend growth and share repurchase programs.

TitanTech’s decision to raise its dividend follows an exceptional fourth quarter performance, in which the company reported a 23% year-over-year increase in revenue, driven by strong demand for its next-generation AI chips and data processing units. CEO Mark Harrison attributed the company’s financial strength to “a combination of robust market adoption, operational efficiency, and strategic partnerships that have allowed us to maintain high profit margins despite macroeconomic challenges.”

The company’s free cash flow for 2024 exceeded $4.2 billion, a record high, providing ample flexibility for continued investment in R&D, strategic acquisitions, and shareholder returns. TitanTech also reaffirmed its 2025 revenue guidance, projecting a 10-12% revenue increase for the upcoming fiscal year.

“Our ability to consistently generate strong cash flow allows us to increase our dividend while also maintaining a healthy capital expenditure plan to drive future innovation,” said CFO Rachel Lin. “We are confident that this balanced approach will enhance shareholder value over the long term.”

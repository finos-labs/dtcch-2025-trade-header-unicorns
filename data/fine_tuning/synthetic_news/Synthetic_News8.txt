Tesla Announces 20% Dividend Increase as Profitability Soars

Detroit, MI – February 4, 2025 – Tesla (TSLA), a leading global manufacturer of electric and hybrid vehicles, announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a 20% increase in its quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.72 per share. The dividend will be payable on March 25, 2025, to shareholders of record as of March 8, 2025, with an ex-dividend date of March 7, 2025. Based on the company’s current stock price, this dividend represents an annualized yield of 3.1%, reflecting Stellar’s commitment to returning capital to shareholders while continuing its investment in next-generation vehicle technologies.

The announcement follows Tesla’s impressive fourth-quarter earnings report, which saw revenue surge 18% year-over-year to $29.6 billion, fueled by record-breaking sales of its flagship EV models. The company also reported a net income of $4.8 billion, exceeding Wall Street expectations and reaffirming its position as a dominant force in the transition to sustainable mobility. CEO Daniel Whitmore attributed the strong performance to increasing consumer demand for electric vehicles, improved production efficiencies, and successful global expansion into key European and Asian markets.

“This dividend increase is a reflection of our strong financial performance, robust cash flow, and confidence in our long-term strategy,” said Whitmore. “As we continue to innovate and scale our production capabilities, we remain committed to delivering sustainable returns to our shareholders while investing in the future of mobility.”

Stellar Automotive has aggressively expanded its battery manufacturing facilities to meet growing demand, with new plants coming online in Germany and Texas by the second half of 2025. The company has also deepened partnerships with key suppliers to secure long-term access to critical raw materials such as lithium and cobalt, ensuring a stable supply chain amid increasing global competition.

Following the dividend announcement, Tesla’s stock climbed 5.2% in early trading, as analysts praised the company’s strong execution and commitment to balancing shareholder returns with continued investment in cutting-edge technology. Major investment firms, including Broadwell Capital and Simmons Equity, raised their price targets for the stock, citing strong demand, resilient margins, and an accelerating shift toward electrification.

CFO Laura Finnegan emphasized that the company’s free cash flow generation remains robust, supporting both capital expenditures and shareholder distributions. “Our dividend yield now stands at 3.1%, which we believe represents an attractive value for investors, given our industry-leading growth trajectory and financial stability. With a payout ratio of 38%, we have ample flexibility to sustain dividend growth while continuing to invest in our future.”

With the ex-dividend date set for March 7, 2025, investors will be watching the company’s upcoming Investor Day in April, where executives are expected to unveil new developments in solid-state battery technology, autonomous vehicle software, and expansion plans into emerging markets.

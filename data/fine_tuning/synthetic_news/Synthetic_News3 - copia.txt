The dividend is set to be paid on March 12, 2025, to shareholders of record as of February 26, with an ex-dividend date of February 25.

With a forward dividend yield of 2.85%, the healthcare giant continues to prioritize shareholder returns while maintaining robust investments in research and innovation.

The announcement follows a strong fourth-quarter earnings report, where J&J posted a 6.8% year-over-year revenue increase, driven by solid growth in its pharmaceutical and MedTech divisions. The company has seen particular momentum in its oncology and immunology segments, with blockbuster drugs such as Stelara and Carvykti exceeding expectations. Meanwhile, its medical device unit benefited from increasing demand for robotic-assisted surgery and advanced cardiovascular solutions.

Following the announcement, shares of JNJ were up 1.3% in pre-market trading, reflecting investor confidence in the company’s financial outlook. Analysts have noted that J&J’s post-Kenvue restructuring has allowed the company to focus on high-margin businesses, setting the stage for continued expansion in biopharmaceuticals and cutting-edge medical technology.
